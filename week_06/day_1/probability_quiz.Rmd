# Probability Quiz

1. If I roll a six-sided dice once, what is the probability of getting a number less than 5?

> 4/6 = 2/3 = 0.66667


2. How many outcomes are there in the sample space of an experiment in which we toss three dice?


```{r}
6 ^3 
```

3. In an experiment where we roll four dice:

 i. how many outcomes are in the event total_equals_5_6_7 (i.e. the total of the four dice equals 5, 6 or 7)?
 
 
```{r}
four_die <- rolldie(4)

four_die <- four_die %>%
  mutate(total = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4)

nrow(four_die)

four_die

four_die %>%
  filter(total %in% c(5,6,7)) %>%
  summarise(n())



```
 
 
 ii. What is the probability of this event? 
 
```{r}

34 / nrow(four_die)


```
 
 
 iii. What assumptions do we apply? 
```{r}

## assume that it is a fair die - ie, that each outcome is equally likely - and mutually exclusive 

```
 

4. Five chairs are placed in a row in a room, along with five people of differing height. The people sit down randomly on the chairs. What is the probability that they sit in order of decreasing height, left to right?

```{r}
library(gtools)

permutations(n = 5, r = 5, repeats.allowed = FALSE)

#probability is one in 120 --

1 / 120

```

 
 5. I roll six dice:
 
    i. what is the probability I see the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in order on the dice, left to right?
    
```{r}
six_die <- rolldie(6)
six_die

nrow(six_die)

six_die_my_perm <- six_die %>%
  filter(isin(., c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), ordered = TRUE))

perm_die_six <- permutations(n = 6, r = 6, repeats.allowed = TRUE)

(prob <- nrow(six_die_my_perm) / nrow(six_die))

1/ nrow(six_die)

```
    
  ii.what is the probability I see one each of the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 on the dice regardless of order?
  
```{r}
six_die_my_comb <- six_die %>%
  filter(isin(., c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), ordered = FALSE))

(nrow(six_die_my_comb)/nrow(six_die))
```
  
 
6. If I draw a single card from a 52-card deck, and it is black, what is the probability that its suit is spades?

```{r}
1/2

```

 
7. 



```{r}
patients <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Carmen", "Dinesh", "Ella", "Fergus", "Gianna", "Henry")

appointments <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 8, r = 5, v = patients, repeats.allowed = FALSE))


```

i. How many different orders can the doctor see patients today? 
```{r}
nrow(appointments)

```

ii.What is the probability of Gianna and Dinesh both being seen today?

```{r}


#need to 

app_g_and_d <- appointments %>%
  filter(isin(., c("Gianna", "Dinesh"), ordered = FALSE))

app_g_and_d

#probability would equal 

(prob_G_D <- nrow(app_g_and_d) / nrow(appointments))



```

iii.What is the probability of Gianna being seen before Dinesh today?
```{r}
app_g_and_d_ordered <- appointments %>%
  filter(isin(., c("Gianna", "Dinesh"), ordered = TRUE))

#probability 

(prob_g_before_d <- nrow(app_g_and_d_ordered) / nrow(appointments))
```

iv. Carmen and Henry have now been triaged as high priority and will be seen in the first two available slots, although their order hasnâ€™t yet been determined. In how many different orders can the patients now be seen?


```{r}
## start by looking at the high priority patients 

high_priority_patients <- c("Carmen", "Henry")

high_pri_apps <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 2, r = 2, v = high_priority_patients, repeats.allowed = FALSE))

high_pri_apps

## now for the remainder 

low_priority_patients <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Dinesh", "Ella", "Fergus", "Gianna")

low_pri_apps <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 6, r = 3, v = low_priority_patients, repeats.allowed = FALSE))

low_pri_apps

names(low_pri_apps) <- c("app3", "app4", "app5")

low_pri_apps

names(high_pri_apps) <- c("app1", "app2")


```


```{r}
## now merge the data frames 

appointments_post_triage <- merge(high_pri_apps, low_pri_apps)

appointments_post_triage

nrow(appointments_post_triage)

#240 combinations now 
```


8. 8. If order is not significant, how many ways are there to select a 5 student quiz team from a group of 8 students?
```{r}

student_quiz_team <- combinations(n = 8, r = 5, repeats.allowed = FALSE)


nrow(student_quiz_team)
```

9. (harder) How would your answer for question 8 change if a team captain had to be selected for each team?

```{r}

#split into two separate questions - as in hospital example
student_quiz_captains <- as_tibble(combinations(n = 8, r = 1, repeats.allowed = FALSE))

student_quiz_captains 


#there are 8 captains 

# multiply this by the combination from n = 7 and r = 4 


student_quiz_team_minus_captain <- combinations(n = 7, r = 4, repeats.allowed = FALSE)

8 * nrow(student_quiz_team_minus_captain)

#280 

```

10. 
```{r}
#set up the dataframe 

uni <- data.frame(
  mother_yes = c(32, 22), 
  mother_no = c(35, 31)
)
uni <- cbind(uni, rowSums(uni))
uni <- rbind(uni, colSums(uni))
colnames(uni) <- c("mother_yes", "mother_no", "sum")
rownames(uni) <- c("son_yes", "son_no", "sum")

uni
```

i. What is the probability that a son attended university given that his mother attended university?
```{r}

total <- 120

#p(son_attend | mother_attend) = p(son_attend AND mother_attend) / p(mother_attend)

(p_son_ye_AND_mother_yes <- uni["son_yes", "mother_yes"] / total)

p_son_yes <- uni["son_yes", "sum"] / total

p_son_no <- uni["son_no", "sum"] / total

(p_mother_yes <- uni["sum", "mother_yes"] / total)

p_mother_no <- uni["sum", "mother_no"] / total

(p_son_yes_GIVEN_mother_yes <- p_son_ye_AND_mother_yes / p_mother_yes)

```


```{r}
#prob son yes given mother no 

(p_son_yes_GIVEN_mother_no <- p_son_ye_AND_mother_yes / p_mother_no)
```


iii. Is attending university by the son independent of whether his mother attended university?

```{r}

```
